# iSTTC

This repository relates to: **iSTTC: a novel method for robust and accurate estimation of intrinsic neural timescales** (hyperlink to the paper).

It includes tools to compute iSTTC-based autocorrelation functions, fit timescales on continuous or epoched spiking data, and replicate analyses from the associated paper.
