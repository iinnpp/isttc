# iSTTC

This repository relates to **iSTTC: a robust method for accurate estimation of intrinsic neural timescales from single-unit recordings** 

Preprint on biorxiv ([here][isttc_biorxiv]).

[isttc_biorxiv]:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.01.668071v1

It includes tools to compute iSTTC-based autocorrelation functions, fit timescales on continuous or epoched spiking data, and replicate analyses from the associated paper.

### Installation

You can install the latest version of **isttc** directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/iinnpp/isttc.git
```
To install with optional plotting and notebook dependencies:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/iinnpp/isttc.git#egg=isttc[plot,notebook]"
```

If you want to modify the code, clone the repository and install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iinnpp/isttc.git
cd isttc
pip install -e .
```

### How to run

Examples of how to use the iSTTC are in the Examples folder:

* generate_syn_data notebook contains code to generate test dataset (10 min long spike trains and sets of 40 x 1000 ms trails)
* estimate_tau notebook contains code to estimate intrinsic timescale using four methods: classic ACF and iSTTC on long spike trains and PearsonR and iSTTC on trials. Notebook generates plot of estimated intrinsic timescale and REE (relative estimation error).
* spike_trains.pkl, trials.pkl and trials_binned.pkl are sample datasets generated with generate_syn_data

### Functions

#### `acf_sttc()`

Computes an **autocorrelation function (ACF)** for a spike train using the modified version of **Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (STTC)** ([Cutts and Eglen 2014][isttc]). This method quantifies temporal dependencies while remaining robust to firing rate variability and sparse spiking.

```python
acf_sttc(signal_, n_lags_, lag_shift_, sttc_dt_, signal_length_, verbose_=False)
```

#### `acf_sttc_trial_concat()`

Computes the **autocorrelation function (ACF)** across multiple spike train trials using a modified **Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (STTC)**. Each trial is **zero-padded** before concatenation to prevent artificial correlations across trial boundaries. 

```python
acf_sttc_trial_concat(spike_train_l_, n_lags_, lag_shift_, sttc_dt_, trial_len_, zero_padding_len_, verbose_=False)
```
